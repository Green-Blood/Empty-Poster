You play as a person on a one-man demonstraton, holding up a blank sign. For most people, a white piece of paper is just that - an empty piece of paper without a message. A blank slate. But for people living under an oppressive regime even something as simple as holding up a sign that has nothing written on it is a risk.  A risk that won't necessarily pay off in any meaningful way. And yet they keep going and doing it, again and again, despite the consequenses, hoping that one day their efforts won't be in vain.

"Russian police arrest demonstrator protesting with blank sign"

Citizens of the Russian Federation have the right to assemble peacefully, without weapons, to hold meetings, rallies and demonstrations, processions and picketing. - Russian Constitution.

Be aware - the game is quite short, so don't get surprised if you reach the end in a matter of minutes or even seconds :P (Made in 48 hours)
